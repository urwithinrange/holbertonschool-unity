## 0x00. Unity - AR Slingshot Game

In this project I created a “slingshot” game in which the application will detect a horizontal plane (like the floor or a table) and generate moving targets on top of the plane. The user can then launch projectiles to hit the targets for points, creating interaction between a screen and the user’s physical space.
